# Intelligent-traffic-lights
 A system that evaluates the traffic density using  sensors and accomplishes dynamic timing slots with different levels. 
 #Brief about the problem and solution
 The conventional traffic system needs to be upgraded to
solve the severe traffic congestion, alleviate transportation
troubles, reduce traffic volume and waiting time, minimize
overall travel time, optimize cars safety and efficiency, and
expand the benefits in health, economic, and environmental
sectors. We  proposes a simple, low-cost, and real time
smart traffic light control system that aims to overcome many
defects and improve the traffic management. The system is
based on  microcontroller that controls the various
operations, monitors the traffic volume and density flow via
 sensors , and changes the lighting transition slots
accordingly.
